  <h1>IOP Motion animation library guide</h1>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>IOP Motion aims to facilitate the creation of robust, simple and performant common animations that enhance the user experience.</p>
  <p>The unique <i>animation sequence</i> feature enables smart one-at-a-time animations that work on any device at any breakpoint.</p>

  <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
  <p>
    <code>IntersectionObserver</code> sits at the heart of the implementation.</p>
  <p>Various selectors can be grouped into animation sequences, so as to enable smooth animations regardless of the given DOM context.</p>
  <p>Detaching animations from the DOM is made possible by utilizing a JS-based configuration object, instead of relying on html classes.</p>
  <p>However, for ease of use, classes and attributes can still be used to quickly tweak animations settings, as presented below.</p>

  <h2>Installlation</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the <code>
        <a href="https://github.com/ideasonpurpose/iop-motion/tree/main/src/assets/js/lib" target="_blank">src/assets/js/lib/</a>
      </code> folder into your project;</li>
    <li>One level above <code>lib/</code>, create an <code>
        <a href="https://github.com/ideasonpurpose/iop-motion/blob/main/src/assets/js/animations.js" target="_blank">animations.js</a>
      </code> file;</li>
    <li>Next, copy the <code>
        <a href="https://github.com/ideasonpurpose/iop-motion/blob/main/src/assets/sass/lib/_iopmotion.scss">sass/lib/iopmotion._scss</a>
      </code> file into your project;</li>
    <li>All done!</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>The library can be configured either via <code>JS</code> (recommended) or using html <code>data attributes</code>.</p>

  <h3>JavaScript Usage</h3>

  <p>Previously, we created an <code>animations.js</code> file. The <code>moveTargets</code> array will contain objects for all our animations configurations.</p>

  <p>Example</p>
  <pre>
    const moveTargets = [
      {
        <b>sel:</b> '.myParagraph', // JS selector, selects <b>all elements</b> with the class <b>.myParagraph</b>
        <b>effect:</b> 'fade-right', // applies the `fade-up` effect on selected elements
        <b>distance:</b> 40, // specifies the amount of movement for fade/slide effects (in px)
        <b>duration:</b> 1000, // specifies the duration time of the animation (in ms)
        <b>delay:</b> 0 // applies a delay between the time the elements enter the viewport and the animation start
      }
    ]
  </pre>

  <h3>HTML Usage</h3>

  <p>The same as above can be accomplished through adding html data-attributes on the desired elements.</p>

  <p>Example</p>
  <pre>
    &lt;p data-motion-effect="fade-right" data-motion-distance="40" data-motion-duration="1000" data-motion-delay="0">My paragraph&laquo/p>
  </pre>
  <p data-motion data-motion-effect="fade-right" data-motion-distance="40" data-motion-duration="1000" data-motion-delay="0">Result</p>

  <h3>Sequencing Usage</h3>
  <p>Currently, sequences can only be set in JS.</p>
  <p>Sequences enable one-after-the-other animations.</p>
  <p>Named sequences enable multiple config objects to belong in the same sequence group.</p>
  <p>(!) In the case of sequences, <code>delay</code> applies to the <b>first</b> element in a sequence and <code>sequenceDelay</code> represents the amount of delay <b>between</b> elements.</p>

  <p>Example</p>
  <pre>
    const moveTargets = [
      {
        sel: '.myParagraph', // selects <b>all</b> elements with the class <b>.myParagraph</b>
        effect: 'fade-right', // applies the `fade-up` effect on selected elements
        distance: 40, // specifies the amount of movement for fade/slide effects (in px)
        duration: 1000, // specifies the duration time of the animation (in ms)
        delay: 0, // applies a delay between the time the elements enter the viewport and the animation start

        <b>sequence: 'mySequence',</b>
        <b>sequenceDelay: 500</b>
      }
    ]
  </pre>

  <div class="row exampleSequence">
    <div class="col-4">Sequence item 1, no <code>delay</code></div>
    <div class="col-4">Sequence item 2, <code>sequenceDelay</code>ed by 500ms.</div>
    <div class="col-4">Sequence item 3, <code>sequenceDelay</code>ed by 500ms.</div>
    <div class="col-4">Sequence item 4, <code>sequenceDelay</code>ed by 500ms.</div>
    <div class="col-4">Sequence item 5, <code>sequenceDelay</code>ed by 500ms.</div>
    <div class="col-4">Sequence item 6, <code>sequenceDelay</code>ed by 500ms.</div>
    <div class="col-4">Sequence item 7, <code>sequenceDelay</code>ed by 500ms.</div>
    <div class="col-4">Sequence item 8, <code>sequenceDelay</code>ed by 500ms.</div>
    <div class="col-4">Sequence item 9, <code>sequenceDelay</code>ed by 500ms.</div>
  </div>

  <h2>Default Configuration</h2>
  <p>Default settings are set in 
      <code>
      <a href="https://github.com/ideasonpurpose/iop-motion/blob/main/src/assets/js/lib/iopmotion_config.js#L11" target="_blank">
    iopmotion_config.js</a>
    </code>

  </p>
  <p>As a shortcut, any selector containing the <code>[data-motion]</code> attribute will be added to the targets list by default.</p>
